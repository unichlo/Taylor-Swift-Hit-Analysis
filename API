o	Returns: Histogram for liveness
•	hist_valence()
o	Purpose: Generates and displays a histogram for the "valence" column in the dataset.
o	Returns: Histogram for valence
•	hist_tempo()
o	Purpose: Generates and displays a histogram for the "tempo" column in the dataset.
o	Returns: Histogram for tempo
•	hist_duration()
o	Purpose: Generates and displays a histogram for the "duration" column in the dataset.
o	Returns: Histogram for duration
•	main()
o	Purpose: Provides the final print of all of the functions
o	Returns: All functions’ final results

# Predictive Stats:
The functions collectively perform predictive analytics, training and evaluating regression models to predict the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs based on audio features. The logistic regression model predicts whether a song's popularity is above or below the median. The results and diagnostic visualizations provide insights into the models' performance and the importance of different features.
•	lin_regression()
o	Purpose: Performs linear regression to predict the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs based on selected audio features. It also calculates and prints the Mean Squared Error and R^2 score for the model. Additionally, it generates a scatter plot of observed vs predicted popularity.
 
o	Returns: Scatter plat observed vs predicted popularity and the mean squared error and r^2 score
•	log_regression()
o	Purpose: Performs logistic regression to predict whether a song's popularity is above or below the median popularity. It conducts a grid search over hyperparameters to find the best model and prints the best parameters, cross- validation accuracy, and standard deviation of accuracy. It also stores the best model, parameters, and scaled datasets as global variables.
o	Returns: prints the best parameters, cross-validation accuracy, and standard deviation of accuracy. It also stores the best model, parameters, and scaled datasets as global variables
•	coeff()
o	Purpose: Retrieves and prints the coefficients and feature importance of the logistic regression model. It displays both the raw coefficients and the sorted feature importance based on absolute coefficient values.
o	Returns: Coefficients and feature importance chart
•	log_plot()
o	Purpose: Generates a scatter plot comparing predicted probabilities and actual values from the logistic regression model. This helps visualize the performance of the model in predicting the positive class.
o	Returns: A scatter plot comparing predicted probabilities to actual values
•	main()
o	Purpose: Executes the main program by calling the lin_regression(), log_regression(), coeff(), and log_plot() functions in sequence.
o	Returns: Final values of all functions are printed


# Diagnostic Analytics:
These functions collectively perform diagnostic analytics on the Taylor Swift dataset, exploring relationships between audio features and popularity and conducting statistical tests to assess the significance of observed differences.
•	corr()
o	Purpose: Generates a correlation matrix and heatmap for selected columns in the dataset, providing insights into the correlation between various audio features and the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs.
o	Returns: Heatmap of different numerical values and the degree of correlation to the popularity of Taylor Swift’s song
•	t_test_acoustic()
o	Purpose: Performs a t-test to compare the acousticness of songs with high and low popularity. It categorizes songs into high and low popularity based on the median popularity and then conducts a statistical test to evaluate the significance of the difference in acousticness between the two groups.
 
o	Returns: Prints the T-Statistic, P-Value, and a statement indicating whether the difference in acousticness between high and low popularity songs is statistically significant.
•	scatter()
o	Purpose: Generates scatterplots between each independent variable (audio features) and the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs. This provides a visual representation of the relationship between each audio feature and the popularity score.
o	Returns: Scatterplot for each independent variable and popularity
•	main()
o	Purpose: Executes the main program by calling the corr(), t_test_acoustic(), and
scatter() functions in sequence.
o	Returns: All final results
